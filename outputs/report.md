# 1 GW+ AI Data Center Construction: Analysis & Projections

*Based on findings from Epoch AI's Frontier Data Centers Hub and X series.*

## Executive Summary

The landscape of AI infrastructure is undergoing a seismic shift. Epoch AI's research identifies a new class of **"Gigawatt-Scale"** data centers—facilities with power capacities exceeding 1000 MW (1 GW)—currently under construction. These projects, driven by hyperscalers and frontier model labs, represent a leap in physical scale and power consumption, comparable to entire metropolitan areas.

## Key Insights

### 1. The Emergence of the >1 GW Class

We have identified **5 confirmed projects** exceeding 1 GW in projected power capacity. This scale is unprecedented; for context, 1 GW is roughly half the peak power demand of New York City on a spring day.

| Project Name | Location | Hyperscaler | Lab Partner | Projected Power | Status/Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microsoft Fairwater** | Wisconsin / Georgia | Microsoft | OpenAI | **3.3 GW** | Late 2027 |
| **Stargate** | Abilene, Texas | Oracle / Microsoft | OpenAI | **2.2 GW** | Mid-2026 |
| **Meta Hyperion** | Holly Ridge, LA | Meta | Meta AI | **2.2 GW** | 2030 |
| **Colossus 2** | Memphis, Tennessee | - | xAI | **1.4 GW** | Rapid Build |
| **Project Rainier** | New Carlisle, Indiana | Amazon | Anthropic | **1.2 GW** | ~1.9 Years |

### 2. Hyperscalers & Labs: A Symbiotic Buildout

The construction is almost exclusively led by major **hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Oracle)** acting as the infrastructure backbone for **Frontier Model Labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI)**.

* **OpenAI** is the primary driver for the two largest known projects (Fairwater and Stargate).
* **xAI** is distinguishing itself with extreme speed, bypassing some traditional partnerships to build independently or with agile arrangements.
* **Anthropic** leverages Amazon's heavy logistical and power infrastructure capabilities.

### 3. "Frontier Speed": Compressing Timeline

Despite the massive increase in scale (from typical ~100 MW sites to >1000 MW), build times are **compressing**.

* **xAI's Colossus 2** targets a **12-month** completion, a pace previously thought impossible for this scale.
* Typical timelines operate around **2 years**, significantly faster than traditional utility-scale infrastructure projects.

## Projections for Future Expansion

Based on the current trajectory and the data from Epoch AI, we project the following trends for 2026-2030:

### 1. The "5 GW Campus" by 2030

With 3.3 GW already planned for 2027, we project that **5 GW campuses** will enter planning stages by late 2025. These will likely require dedicated SMR (Small Modular Reactor) or direct grid-interconnect agreements that bypass traditional utility queues.

### 2. Geographic Centralization

Construction is clustering in regions with specific characteristics:

* **High Power Availability:** Areas near major transmission lines or power plants (e.g., nuclear sites).
* **Land Availability:** Rural areas in Texas, the Midwest (Indiana, Wisconsin), and the South (Louisiana, Georgia).
* **Regulatory Speed:** States with streamlined permitting processes will capture the bulk of this investment.

### 3. Power as the Primary Bottleneck

The constraint on expansion will shift entirely from silicon availability (GPUs) to **power availability**. Future expansion will be dictated not by capital but by the ability to secure gigawatt-scale interconnects. We expect hyperscalers to begin vertically integrating power generation (investing directly in solar + storage or nuclear) to guarantee supply for these 1 GW+ sites.
